# 🏥 Modernization of Legacy Healthcare Management System

This repository contains the proposal and planning documentation for a system modernization project. The objective is to technically upgrade a Legacy Healthcare Management System (HMS) originally built in 1997 using outdated technologies like Progress 10C and Silverlight.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To modernize the existing system's backend and user interface while preserving its original business logic. The upgraded system will improve accessibility, maintainability, and long-term scalability by:

- Migrating to a modular, API-based backend
- Designing a responsive web-based frontend
- Implementing improved authentication and browser support
- Maintaining core modules: Billing, Accounts, Materials, and Reports
